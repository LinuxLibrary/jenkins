- To have this feature you need to install the HipChat Plugin.
```
	* Go to "Manage Jenkins"
	* Click on "Manage Plugins"
	* Click on "Available tab"
	* In the filter search for "HipChat"
	* Select "HipChat Plugin" and click on "Install without restart"
```
- Now restart your jenkins. You can do it depending on the way using jenkins.
```
	- If you are using jenkins directly then 

		* service jenkins restart

	- If you are using jenkins through tomcat then

		* Login to your tomcat webui, go to "Manager App" and click on "Reload Jenkins"
			(or)
		* http://<HOSTNAME/IP>:8080/jenkins/restart
```
- Now you need to login to your HipChat web-ui and go to the room on which you have Admin access.

> NOTE : To get admin access you need to create a room. You will be admin of the room that you've created.
```
	* Login to your hipchat account ( https://<my-hipchat>.hipchat.com/rooms/ )

	* Find and click on the room you've created.
	* Click on "Tokens"
	* Under the "Create new token" section provide a lable for your notification message.
	* Select "Send Notification" from "Scopes"
	* Click on Create.
```
	-- Above the "Create new token" section you'll get the Token with the lable you've give.
```
		* Copy that token.
```
	-- Now in the url after "tokens/" you'll notice a number that is your room number.
```
		* Copy that number.
```
- Now you need to configure these details in Jenkins.
```
	* Go to your jenkins home page click on "Manage Jenkins"
	* Click on "Configure System"
	* Go to "Global HipChat Notifier Settings" and provide the following settings
		* HipChat Server 	: api.hipchat.com

	* Click Save
```
- Now in your project add the "Post-build Actions"
```
	* Click on "Add post-build action"
	* Select "HipChat Notifications" and provide the following details
		* Project Room		: <Paste your room-id here>
	* Under message templates provide the following values to get your build status notification.
		* Job started	:	${JOB_NAME} #${BUILD_NUMBER}  ---  $STATUS  ---  ${URL}
