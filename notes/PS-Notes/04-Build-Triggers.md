# Build Triggers

- For Continuous Ingration process we need to have the Build Triggers configured
- Polling the SCM (Source Code Management) is an option which allows the project to trigger a build automatically on a code checkin.
- To configure this:
  - Open your project
  - Select `Configure`
  - Select `Build Triggers`
  - Check `Poll SCM`
