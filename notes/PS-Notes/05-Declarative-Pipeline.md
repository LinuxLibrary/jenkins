# Declarative Pipeline

- Let us configure a Pipeline job now.
  - We have 2 different pipeline jobs
    - **Scripted**: Starts with a `node` block
    - **Declarative**: Starts with a `pipeline` block
- Let us use the Declarative pipeline for our case now and will create a pipeline job which would do the same as [03-FreeStyle-Project-with-Post-Actions.md](03-FreeStyle-Project-with-Post-Actions.md)
