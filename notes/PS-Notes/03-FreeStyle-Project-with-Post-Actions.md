- Build triggers: For Continuous Integration we have 2 options. We have several other options too.
  - `GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling`
    - Once you check-in the code then the payload will be posted to GitHub through webhook
  - `Poll SCM`
    - In some case if you can't work with the webhook then you can opt this option
    - This option scans the git repository for the period you mention
- In the build section input your command
  - `./mvnw package`
- If you want your package you need to archive the artifact
  - In the `Post-build Actions` select `Archive the artifacts`
  - Input `target/*.jar`
- If you want to see your test results in a nice formated way
  - In the `Post-build Actions` select `Publish JUnit test result report`
  - Input the location of your test reports
    - `target/surefire-reports/*.xml`
